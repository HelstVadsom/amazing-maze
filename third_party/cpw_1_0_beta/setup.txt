
Getting a Cpw project up and running in Visual C++.

1) Create the project in visual C++. You can create
   a console or windows application. For windowed apps
   I'd suggest creating a "Basic Windows App".

2) Cut and paste the contents of the basic template 
   into the .cpp that was created with the project.
   You can remove any pre-generated code except maybe
   #include stdafx.h if you use that.

3) In the project directory, create a cpw sub directory.

4) Copy the include directory into this sub folder. 

5) Copy the Cpw.h file into the sub directory.
   
6) add an include search path to 'cpw'. Under Project -> settings ->
   c/c++ tab, select Preprocessor from drop down and add
   'cpw' to the "additional include directories" text entry. 

7) Copy the CpwDLL.lib, CpwDLL.dll, and Cpw license into 
   the project directory. You can put these in the cpw 
   sub dir, but you'll have to add a 'library include path'
   to the project settings too.

Result:

   myproject/myproject.c or .cpp (containing template code)
   myproject/cpw/include/*.*
   myproject/cpw/cpw.h
   myproject/CpwDLL.lib
   myproject/CpwDLL.dll
   myproject/CpwLicense.txt

Build the project and have fun programming in OpenGL!
