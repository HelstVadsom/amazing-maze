
OpenAL, the Open Audio Library, is an open, cross-platform API for 
interactive, primarily spatialized audio. Its primary audience is 
application developers and desktop users that rely on portable 
standards like OpenGL, for games and other multimedia applications. 

To compile the CpwDLLext with OpenAL, first go here to download the OpenAL
Developer SDK. (for win32)

Or goto http://www.openal.org/ for other platform distributions.

You'll need the OpenAL library and DLL and the include files. The
Cpw project / make files will need to be modified so the know where 
these files are located.
